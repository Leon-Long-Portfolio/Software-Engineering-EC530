# Software Engineering Fundamentals: GitHub
This repository houses a simple matrix multiplier project, designed to demonstrate the application of real-world software engineering principles through practical examples. Leveraged by the robustness of PyTest, my project goes beyond mere functionality to ensure reliability and performance under various conditions. I crafted comprehensive test cases to cover a wide array of scenarios including incorrect inputs, error states, and successful computations, ensuring my implementation stands up to rigorous scrutiny. Beyond correctness, the repository also focuses on performance metrics such as CPU and memory usage, providing a more comprehensive view of my solution's efficiency. Logging and code coverage analysis further enhance my project's maintainability and transparency. Integrating GitHub Actions, I dive into the world of professional software engineering practices, facilitating continuous integration and delivery to simulate a real-world development environment. The main takeaways are the principles of testing, performance optimization, and continuous development.

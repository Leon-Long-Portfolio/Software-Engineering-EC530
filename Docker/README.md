# Introduction to Docker
In this project, I developed a Python application that efficiently performs matrix multiplication, showcasing foundational concepts in linear algebra and software engineering. The application, matrix_multi.py, implements an algorithm to multiply two matrices, handling various edge cases such as dimension mismatches and empty matrices. To ensure the robustness of our solution, we created a comprehensive test suite in test_matrix_multi.py, leveraging pytest for validation. Additionally, I containerized our application using Docker to streamline deployment and execution across diverse environments. This involved crafting a Dockerfile that specifies the application's environment, dependencies, and execution instructions, thereby encapsulating the application in a portable and scalable manner. The project is structured to include both the application code and Docker configuration, providing a comprehensive example of modern application development and deployment practices.
